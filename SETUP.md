# Setting up the AutoResponder app

In order to use the integration, we must add a rule in the responder. This is how it works

## Creating a new rule

<p>First we need to click the green button in the bottom right corner</p>

## Entering server details

<p>Now you need to enter the server details. Please use the format <code>http(s)://(server ip):(server port)/</code>. You can define the port in the integration itself.
<b>It is also recommended to use authentication to secure the process</b>
</p>

## Setting the receiver

<p>If you want to send all requests to the responder, please set the receiver to <code>Both</code>. If you only want to use this extension for chats or groups, please use that option.</p>
